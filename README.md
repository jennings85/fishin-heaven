# Fishin’ Heaven

Basic Summary:
Fishin’ Heaven (a play on Fishing Heaven and Fish In Heaven) is a game that melds classic 3D RPG elements, diverse and expansive fishing mechanics, and a rich lore consisting of mythical god-like beings in a heavenly realm. 

Basic Game Details:
Developed in Unity with C#

Story Elements:
Fish Heaven (name unknown) consists of many ancient gods at war and furious over the chaotic state of their world. Some want peace, others want power, and all control fish. The fish in this world vary from virtually mindless beings to advanced thinkers but almost all are abnormally devout to their religion. The average fish speaks only praise of their lord and ultimately commits their being to give their god power. A god with no fish is one of mortality and weakness. Designated fish will play a role in the story as creatures who struggle to do more than command for religion. Some specific fish will be of an atheist nature with unique powers. Currently gods are humanoid spirits resembling Greek gods.

Game Mechanics:
Fish are caught with differing purposes. Some may be used for battle sequences while others are for selling, harvesting items, abilities, etc.

All catchable fish are religious and require special rods and abilities to catch depending on their religious affiliation. 

Unique rods will be handed down from gods and potentially atheist fish to allow a unique mechanic to acquire fish. For example, fish and rods of Religion A may utilize a 2D display that forces the player to keep an object within bounds as it requires precision (Stardew Valley). Other religions and rods may utilize a simpler drag back rod and cast into fish hotspot type of mechanic (Toontown). Rods are intended to bestow unique abilities and region locked impacts that increase in difficulty.
